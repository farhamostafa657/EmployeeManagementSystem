## Employee management system
#### I used springboot as a backend and react js as a frontend
## Backend (Spring Boot):
#### RESTful API:I designed my  backend using RESTful principles to create APIs for managing employees, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
#### Database Integration: Configure my application to connect to a database (MySQL) using Spring Data JPA. I defined entities for employees and any related data.
## Frontend (React.js):
#### API Integration: I used axios to communicate with my Spring Boot backend and consume RESTful APIs.
#### Routing: using React Router to navigate between different views/pages of my application.
#### User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface using bootstrap frameworks .
